# Unity programming theory

This is my submission for the course "Junior Programmer: Apply object-oriented principles" of the "Junior programmer" pathway.
This submission is the last one before finishing the pathway.
Here, I developed a scene where I made 2 different toasters, and 2 different type of bread.
Mixing breads with toasters will get different results :
Normal bread with normal toaster will get you normal toast. (on the left)
Premium bread with premium toaster will get you premium toast. (middle)
Premium bread with normal toaster will get you normal toast, and premium bread cooking speed. (right)
