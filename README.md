# Unity programming theory

This is my submission for the course "Junior Programmer: Apply object-oriented principles" of the "Junior programmer" pathway.__
This submission is the last one before finishing the pathway.__
Here, I developed a scene where I made 2 different toasters, and 2 different type of bread.__
Mixing breads with toasters will get different results :__
- Normal bread with normal toaster will get you normal toast. (on the left)
- Premium bread with premium toaster will get you premium toast. (middle)
- Premium bread with normal toaster will get you normal toast, and premium bread cooking speed. (right)
