# Unity programming theory

This is my submission for the course "Junior Programmer: Apply object-oriented principles" of the "Junior programmer" pathway.  
This submission is the last one before finishing the pathway.  
Here, I developed a scene where I made 2 different toasters, and 2 different type of bread.  
Mixing breads with toasters will get different results :  
- Normal bread with normal toaster will get you normal toast. (on the left)
- Premium bread with premium toaster will get you premium toast. (middle)
- Premium bread with normal toaster will get you normal toast, at premium bread cooking speed. (right)
For this, I used the 4 pillars of OOP : Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance & Polymorphism
